The outermost layer represents the JFrame, which acts as the root pane.
The title bar at the top contains the title of the window, along with optional icons and buttons for minimizing, maximizing, and closing the window.
Below the title bar, there is space for a menu bar if one is added to the frame.
The main area of the window is the content pane, where you typically add your Swing components such as buttons, labels, text fields, etc.
The content pane is managed by the root pane and is where most of the application's GUI is displayed.
The menu bar, if present, overlays the top of the content pane but is part of the root pane.
Other layers, such as the layered pane and glass pane, are not shown in this simplified illustration but are also managed by the root pane.
